    <h1>My 3 Favorites Recipes</h1>


    <section class="foodintro">One of my favorite foods is curry. I love the combination of spices and flavors in each bite. Chicken or lamb are my favorite protein options in curries, and I always ask for it to be a little spicy to add a touch of excitement to my palate. Basmati rice is the perfect accompaniment to this dish, helping to balance out the strong flavors of the curry. Another of my favorite foods is the hamburger, but not just any hamburger: a juicy, spicy meat burger with a touch of curry. I love the combination of spices in the meat, along with a good amount of melted cheese, crisp onion and fresh tomato. If the burger comes with fries, even better. Last but not least, lasagna is definitely one of my favorite foods. The smooth ricotta cheese, rich tomato sauce, and soft pasta are a perfect match. I like to make my lasagna with ground meat, but it's also delicious with roasted vegetables or even a mix of both. Freshly grated Parmesan cheese on top is a must-have finishing touch to give it that extra, gratin flavor.</section>
